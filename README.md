The folder contains the python and jupyter notebook file containing all functions and libraries used to compute the persistent barcodes, \
persistent lifetimes, Betti-curves etc on the density data. 

The density file must inlcude the dimensions and the grids for proper execution. 
For example, a 2-d image with 100*100 bins should include \
2 \
100 \
100 \
in the begining of the density file. 

The files are executable with proper libraries
